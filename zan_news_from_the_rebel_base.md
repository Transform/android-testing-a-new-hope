## News from the rebel base

So I/O has gone and went, with some exciting news for the test anthusiasts.

First and biggest one is the addition of the Google Cloud testing lab - a way to spawn emulators and real devices for testing remotely and in parallel. Nothing really substantial here yet, but we'll see in the following months.

The other one is the updated espresso and testing support library - I'm especially keen on the new @VisibleForTesting annotation, that allows you finer control of your tests, and your tests to access private methods as well.
