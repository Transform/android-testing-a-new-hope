## Introduction
Presented by Nic Jackson and Zan Markan, who work on the native apps team at Marks and Spencer, our talk will take a brief look at the different options available for Android testing. Driven from our experience of rebuilding the M&S Android app and from a love for TDD and BDD, it's going to be a fun-filled action-packed approach, littered with tenuous Star Wars references and geek humour.

## Who we are
We're experienced and passionate presenters having both given many speeches in the past. (Zan presented the Death Goblin talk at Droidcon London barcamp 2014 and Nic hosts the Wild West Tech Talks).

## Content
We will concentrate on cold facts with possible section names:
* Retrospective of new testing developments from Google I/O - News from the Rebel base (We are obviously not sure what that is going to be before I/O in May)
* Current options for Android Testing - How to bullseye a womp rat
* Unit Testing on the JVM vs Roboelectric - Even R2 makes mistakes
* A look at the pros and cons of Calabash - The Empire's secret weapon
* BDD using Cucumber JVM with Activity Instrumentation Testing - "Search your feelings, father! You can do this"
* Pros and Cons of mimicking and integration testing with a real endpoint - "Thats no moon! It's a space station!"
* Efficient testing - "How to make your CI run in less than 12 parsecs"

##  Why
We strongly believe that conferences are often lacking in humour and therefore intend to bring some to the table, quite literally during the lunch quickie sessions.
